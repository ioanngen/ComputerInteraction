# ComputerInteraction

This project was created by a team of three, and it is a front-end only focused personal assistant developed using C# and Windows Forms. We created windows such as the main menu, login, register, music player, email client, smart home control, appointments and others, with the purpose of simplifying the interfaces of different apps and gathering them all in one place, making it easier for people to interact with the computer.
